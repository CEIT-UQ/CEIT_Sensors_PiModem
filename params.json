Following the instructions below will allow you to set up the pimodem, or you can download a clone of the already setup image and use that.\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n**Install dependencies.**\r\n```\r\n 1. sudo apt-get install python-pip\r\n 2. sudo pip install pyserial mosquitto\r\n 3. git clone https://github.com/craigknott/CEIT_Sensors_PiModem\r\n 4. cd CEIT_Sensors_PiModem/pyswap/\r\n 5. sudo python setup.py install\r\n```\r\n**Setup cronjob to restart wifi on disconnect**\r\n```\r\n 1. sudo crontab -e\r\n 2. add the following lines, replacing /path/to with the path to your CEIT_Sensors_PiModem clone.\r\n 3. '* * * * * /path/to/CEIT_Sensors_PiModem/wifi_persist.sh'\r\n 4. '0 * * * * /path/to/CEIT_Sensors_PiModem/gitpull.sh'\r\n 5. save and exit\r\n 6. make sure wifi_persist.sh has execute priveledge.\r\n```\r\n**Setup daemontools to automatically monitor and reboot script on shutdown.**\r\n```\r\n 1. sudo apt-get install daemontools daemontools-run\r\n 2. sudo mkdir /etc/service/ /etc/service/lib /etc/service/lib/log\r\n 3. make a file called run in /etc/service/lib/ and give it execute priveleges (chmod +x /etc/service/lib/run)\r\n 4. repeat 3 in the /etc/service/lib/log/ folder.\r\n 5. write the following to /etc/service/lib/run, replacing 401 with the PIs ID number.\r\n    #!/bin/bash\r\n    exec python /path/to/CEIT_Sensors_PiModem/swapmanager.py 401\r\n 6. write the following to /etc/service/lib/log/run\r\n    #!/bin/bash\r\n    exec 2>&1\r\n    exec multilog t /var/log/lib_log\r\n```\r\n## Run\r\nTHATS IT YOU'RE DONE!\r\nUnless you chose not to use daemontools in which case run as below.\r\n```\r\n 1. sudo python swapmanager.py XXX [where XXX is the ID of the RPi you are using, first number is the floor of the building]\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
